# Code for Climate 1

1.	Why to code for Climate? - Dhritiraj Sengupta, - Post Doctoral Researcher. SKLEC, East China Normal University & SC member, IGUâ€™s Commission on Coastal Systems. 

According to latest study, the intensity of change in our local climate has changed tremendously. How to act with data science? Learn about the available tools of advanced geospatial technology enabling everyone to understand and communicate climate change by applying geo data science and Earth Observation techniques.  This session will include a demo on global to local scale Earth Observation and geo data acquisition using Google Earth Engine.

2.	A better picture on air with big data analytics Dr Xiafu Shi, R&D manager, Woxford Environmental Technology Ltd.

Networks of monitoring stations are being used to collect data on air pollution, providing the best possible information for climate researchers, businesses and governments who want to take steps to improve air quality. With the large volumes of data available, we can adopt data science techniques to acquire, process and create visualizations of air quality, which can help researchers and planners draw connections between geospatial and data. In this session, you will learn to use Jupyter notebook and various python packages to source air pollution data, explore and process data, and time series analysis to figure out cycles, seasonality, and spatial movement. A demo followed by hands-on session will enable you to build simple air forecasting tools for your own city. 
3.	Geospatial Network analysis

A hands on session on understanding the basics of network analysis. This session will be focused on geospatial networks i.e roads covering concepts of centrality and how to measure your vehicular CO2 emissions from point A to B.
